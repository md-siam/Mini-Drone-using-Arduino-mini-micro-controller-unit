# Mini Drone using Arduino mini micro controller unit
<p align="justify" >
It is a low-cost drone made using Arduino mini, DC motors, and a mobile battery. It can be controlled by an android application. The connection between the drone and the application is done by the Bluetooth module present in the Arduino mini. Physically, it is a tricopter with three lightweight motors, which produces upward thrust more than the overall weight of the drone. Hence, causes it to go upwards.

### What is a tricoptor?
<p align="justify" >
* Itâ€™s an aircraft similar to a helicopter except it has three rotor .
<br>* The beauty of the design is that it derives lift and propulsion from  three sets of horizontally revolving rotors.
